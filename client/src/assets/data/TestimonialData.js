    testimonial:
      'We LOVE Okane Tracker!!! We have been using it for 5 years and it has helped us stay on budget and become completely debt free! I didn’t want an app that actually synced with my bank accounts, just one where we could be mindful to track what we are spending, and that is exactly what this does. We paid the extra $5.99 for the premium account so that my husband and I could sync our accounts. That has been SO helpful.',

    testimonial:
      "This app is perfect. It doesn't have flashy colored icons and it's been just a joy to use them. Some features I need: recurring transactions, future transactions, custom categories, pie chart, category budgets, and most importantly, the ability to make negative transactions (returns and refunds) as part of the original expense category! It's all here! Wish I'd found it sooner.",

    testimonial:
      'This app is perfect for what I need. I love how simple and easy it is to use. Now I can look at the summaries page and think “wow I spent a lot of money in the ‘online shopping’ category. I wonder what I spend it on?”. Thank you!',

    testimonial:
      'I’ve had this app for a couple of years now, and I can definitely so it’s worth it. It works as intended. It’s free but you can pay a one time premium which I like. Everything is done manually, except for the report, which is really nice.',

    testimonial:
      'I’ve downloaded and tried more than a dozen expense tracking apps and most didn’t work for me. At first this one seemed too simple, but it helped me to save $1000. Highly recommend especially if you’re trying to track receipts, payments and income. ',
